We need to write a cover letter for an Upwork job proposal.
As a context for the cover letter, you have the following information:
- The job proposal details
- Relevant company information
- Information about the person applying for the job
- 1 or 2 best-matching cases from our IT company.

Tone of voice: friendly, easy-to-read.
Please do not add any extra or non-factual information â€” only use the info provided.

<job-proposal>
{jobInfo}
</job-proposal>

<company-info>
{companyInfo}
</company-info>

<applicant-info>
{applicantInfo}
</applicant-info>

<cases>
{cases}
</cases>

The structure of the cover letter should be as follows:
1. Hook + case demonstration:
- Start with a hook that grabs the client's attention.
- Present the case that best match the job proposal. The idea is "You want a Data Management platform? Look, I've done that already!".
- Explain why the case is relevant to the job proposal.
- Focus on the metrics, results and benefits of the case.
- Be concise and to the point.

2. Second case demonstration (optional):
- If applicable, present the second best-matching case.
- Explain why the case is relevant to the job proposal.

4. Facts about the applicant:
- Mention the applicant's skills, experience, and achievements.

- Be concise and to the point.

5. About our team/company (optional):

- Use the following templates as reference: "My team & I can deliver a project of any complexity, and I would be very happy to jump on a call and convenience you!"

6. Call to action:
- Main idea here is to ask the client to jump on call.

 Which time works best for you?" or "Is it worth chatting? Which time works best for you?"

7. Name of the applicant:
