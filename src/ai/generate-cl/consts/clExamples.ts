Does vtnews.ai (which I built for PBD in 4.5 months) look like a complex project for you? Or vendori.com, which my team and I delivered in 18 months? 

I know how to deliver top-notch, world-class projects in short terms.

Building such a massive all-in-one project is ambitious and requires a good discovery phase with proper planning. But you're lucky: My team just launched vtnews.aiâ€”the project we built for PBD (which has 2B+ podcast views per year). It has a deep payments integration, powerful infrastructure, and a system that is SOC-2 and ISO-27001 compliant. We're ready to bring to life your automation workflow platform for marketing agencies.

On top of that project, more "Why we?" and "Why now?":

1. I'm CTO @ Code & Cakes, Expert-Vetted on UpWork.
2. I bring my decade of experience to any project we have in the team.
3. We have already built almost 50 different projects, the latest: aisdr.com, amerikapostam.com, marketsai.com

I am currently in SF, which gives us a huge advantage, as AI here is months ahead of the rest of the world.

I'm super happy to jump on a call, show more examples, and answer any questions. Which time works for you?
